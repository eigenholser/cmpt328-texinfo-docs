CMPT328 Computer Architecture
=============================

Various documents for Westminster College Spring 2015 CMPT328 Computer
Architecture course. Includes homework exercises solutions, lab exercises, and
instructions.

To build, install a complete LaTeX package with TexInfo and PDFTex. Build
all documents by invoking ``make`` in the root. Build one document by changing
to that directory and also invoking ``make.``

Create a new document by using the ``package.sh`` shell script. It will create
a new TexInfo document directory from the ``template`` directory.

There is more but that is the happy path.
